/**
 * The walkie's gain on what the microphone captured, before the encoder (docs/VOICE_CALLS.md §3.11, C-3.11-5). A live
 * call's capture goes through WebRTC's gain control; the walkie's comes from the phone's flat `VOICE_RECOGNITION`
 * path, which has none, and it played far quieter than a call at the same volume. So speech is brought toward
 * [TARGET_DB] RMS here, by at most [MAX_GAIN_DB] and never below unity.
 *
 * Slow up, fast down: the gain falls at once toward a loud frame's need and rises at most [RISE_DB_PER_FRAME] per frame
 * of speech, so it settles near the loud syllables instead of pumping the quiet ones up. It holds between words, where
 * a frame is not speech: within 12 dB of the quietest frame of the last 2 s (the noise floor, which a steady hum
 * becomes), or under [MIN_SPEECH_DB]. A limiter keeps every frame's peak under [CEILING_DB]. It is kept across bursts,
 * one per microphone, so a session's second burst starts where the first left off.
 *
 * Works on 16-bit little-endian mono PCM in place, one 20 ms frame per [apply]. Not thread-safe: the capture loop owns
 * it.
