 * One live data-path link to a peer over a connected [LinkSocket] — the **transport-agnostic** per-connection
 * machinery extracted from the Wi-Fi Aware transport so the Bluetooth transport reuses it byte-for-byte. It
 * owns the [LinkFraming] record loops (frames + interleaved file streaming + store-and-forward digests) and
 * raises decoded results up via [LinkCallbacks]; it does **not** own discovery, admission, or teardown policy
 * (those stay in each transport — e.g. NAN's single-NDI quiescence supervisor reads [lastActivityAt]/
 * [linkStartedAt]/[rxInProgress]/[txInProgress] here to decide when to tear an ephemeral sync down; Bluetooth
 * keeps links persistent).
 *
 * Pure of Android: the wall clock is injected ([now]) and logging is a lambda ([log]) so the loops are
 * JVM-unit-testable over a piped [LinkSocket] ([app.getknit.knit.FramedLinkTest]). Callers pass
 * `SystemClock::elapsedRealtime` for [now] so the quiescence props share the supervisor's clock.
