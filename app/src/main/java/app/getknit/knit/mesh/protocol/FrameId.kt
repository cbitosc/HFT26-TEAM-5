/**
 * Mints a compact, globally-unique frame/request id: 128 random bits ([SecureRandom]) rendered as a
 * 22-char unpadded base64url string. Replaces `UUID.randomUUID().toString()` (36 chars — hex with
 * hyphens — for the same entropy). The id is opaque and forwarded verbatim (it is the dedup key, the
 * custody key, and what a receipt/reaction references), so only uniqueness matters; a tighter encoding
 * just trims every chat/reaction/receipt frame that carries one. base64url (`[A-Za-z0-9_-]`, no padding)
 * keeps it CBOR-text-, URL-, and filename-safe.
 *
 * **Not opaque on the way in** (ADR 2026-10.9qr4, #178). Every inbound door refuses a frame whose id is not one of the
 * three shapes [admits] names, so changing this format, or minting any other shape, is a wire break: every build
 * that ships before the change drops the new ids. The gate exists because Android's database binds every string as
 * UTF-16, and SQLite drops one leading U+FEFF there (and byte-swaps the rest after a leading U+FFFE): an id that is
 * opaque to Kotlin and an iPhone is one custody and message row with its unmarked twin on this phone.
