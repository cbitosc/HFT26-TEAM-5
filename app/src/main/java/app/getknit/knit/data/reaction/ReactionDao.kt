     * id, no Meshtastic origin (a heard post sits in our sender column by convention), an ordinary message
     * (`kind = 0`, never a notice). Reactors in [blocked] are left out, as their messages are on the list.
     *
     * Only someone who reads the thread counts — the rule the notification keeps (`InboundPipeline.readsThread`,
     * ADR 2026-10.59fu): in a DM the peer (whose id is the thread's), in a group a member of its roster, in a room
     * ([rooms], or a commons by [commonsGlob]) anyone. Every carrier sees a DM's frame ids, so without it a
     * stranger's reaction would head the row, and a DM's line names nobody: it would read as the peer's. A
     * roster is a JSON array of node ids, which carry no quote, `%` or `_`, so the quoted LIKE is exact (the
     * `MessageDao.sealedHolding` precedent).
     *
     * Shape: the driver is the reactions table, joined to `messages` by primary key, so the cost tracks how many
     * reactions this phone holds rather than how many messages. The inner pass takes each thread's newest
     * `updatedAt`; the outer pass joins back to the rows at that instant. A same-millisecond tie returns every
     * tied row and the repository breaks it by id (`ReactionRepository.observeNewestOnOwn`), so the line cannot
     * flip between emissions — the bare `MAX … GROUP BY` idiom would pick an arbitrary one. Tombstones never
     * qualify, so a retraction drops its reaction from here and the row falls back on its own.
