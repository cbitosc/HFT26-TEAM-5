/**
 * The one Wi-Fi Direct radio, shared by whoever needs a group — a file transfer, or a call between neighbours
 * (`call/DirectCallPath`) — and owned by one of them at a time. [radio] has a single channel and a global
 * [DirectWifi.release]: it removes whatever group is up and hands the radio back to the mesh, and the transfer's
 * manager calls it on every end path, whether or not it ever hosted. So nobody uses [radio] directly; each user
 * holds the view [leasedTo] returns, which takes the lease on its first host or join and gives it back on its own
 * release. A view whose owner does not hold the lease is refused ([TransferRefusal.Busy]) and releases nothing.
 *
 * It is also where [gate] keeps a phone from hosting where hosting takes the phone down (ADR 2026-10.w3dw): every
 * group goes up through here, so a host the gate refuses never reaches `createGroup`, and the gate hears when a group
 * of ours goes up and comes down. A join is never refused for it.
