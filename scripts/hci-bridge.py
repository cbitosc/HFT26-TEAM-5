"""Put a real Bluetooth controller under an emulator's own Bluetooth stack, with a tap and faults in between.

    uv run scripts/hci-bridge.py serve --controller usb:2fe3:000b/SERIAL [--port 8877] [--control 8878]
        [--snoop FILE.btsnoop] [--trace] [--isolate]

    uv run scripts/hci-bridge.py ctl deafen SECONDS

The emulator's Bluetooth HAL speaks netsim's packet-streamer gRPC; `emulator -packet-streamer-endpoint
localhost:PORT` points it here instead of at netsim, and Bumble's `android-netsim:…,mode=controller` transport is
the server end. The other end is any Bumble controller transport, here the nRF52840 dongles knit-ios flashed with
`firmware/knit-hci` (Zephyr `hci_usb`, no vendor firmware to load). So the app, the AOSP host stack and the real
controller are all the shipped ones; only the cable between the host stack and the controller is ours. That is the
point: everything the host stack says to the controller, and everything the controller answers, passes through here.

- **The tap.** `--snoop` writes a btsnoop file (Wireshark, `btmon -r`), the same records a phone's
  "Bluetooth HCI snoop log" keeps, live on the host. The log line per event is the short oracle: every connection
  up/down with its handle, role, peer and reason, PHY and parameter updates, and every command the real controller
  answered with an error (`controller refused …`) — the refusals ADR 2026-10.9utz had to infer from logcat.
- **Faults, armed at run time** through the control port (JSON lines on localhost; `ctl` is the client):
  - `refuse OPCODE STATUS` answers the next COUNT matching host commands with STATUS and never forwards them —
    Command Status for the commands the spec answers that way, else Command Complete with STATUS and PAD zero bytes
    (a command whose return carries more than a status needs its length padded, or the host stack may reject the
    event). `--param0` matches only commands whose first parameter byte is that value (0x2039 with 0x01 is an
    *enable*). `refuse 0x2039 0x0d` is 9utz's refusal on demand.
  - `cut` drops a live link the way a fade does: the bridge sends the controller an HCI Disconnect of its own,
    swallows its Command Status, and hands the host the Disconnection Complete with REASON (0x08, connection timeout,
    by default). Injected commands wait for the host's commands to drain first, so the command-credit count the
    host keeps never moves. **The fade is one-sided:** the far side gets an LL terminate at once (0x13, remote user
    terminated) instead of waiting out its own supervision timeout, so a relink timed from the far side reads
    faster than after a real fade. Only the emulator's side of a cut is evidence; a two-sided fade needs the
    controller to stop transmitting, which is a firmware change (a vendor command in knit-ios's `knit-hci`).
  - `deafen` drops advertising reports on their way to the host for SECONDS: the scan runs, the host hears nothing.
- **Isolation (`--isolate`).** Two bridged emulators that should mesh with each other and nobody else, over the
  real air. Knit finds a peer only by its 16-bit service UUIDs (`BleConstants`: 0xFE30 presence, 0xFE38 side
  pages), so an isolating bridge moves them in every advert its host hands the controller (to 0xFE20 / 0xFE28,
  `ISOLATED_UUIDS`) and moves them back in every report the controller hands up. A report that carried a moved
  UUID is a partner's; its address is remembered, so the rest of that advertiser's reports (a fragment's tail, a
  scan response) pass too, and every other report is dropped before the host sees it. So the lab phones and the
  iPhone hear no Knit advert from the pair, the pair hears none of theirs, and between the two the app, the host
  stack, the controllers and the RF are all the real ones: only 2 bytes of each advert differ on air. Dropped
  reports stay out of the capture (a busy room is tens a second); `counts.adv_isolated` counts them and `ctl
  status` lists the partner addresses heard.
- **The shim (`--no-shim` turns it off).** The nRF52840 has no BR/EDR radio, and Android's stack assumes one: GD
  aborts on a Read Local Name it cannot parse, and `btm_sec_dev_reset` refuses a controller without Secure Simple
  Pairing. So when the controller answers one of a fixed list of BR/EDR housekeeping commands with "unknown
  command", the bridge answers success with spec-sized return parameters (`SHIM`); Read Local Extended Features is
  answered from the controller's own Read Local Supported Features, plus the SSP bit (`CLAIMED_FEATURES`). Nothing
  BR/EDR ever reaches the controller to use them. `ctl status` lists what was shimmed.
- **The scan arbiter (off with the shim).** GD dials with its scan on, which a phone's controller allows. Zephyr's
  initiator runs on its scanner and answers that dial Command Disallowed (0x0c), so on 2026-10-04 every dial of a
  second boot failed. The bridge turns the scanner off before forwarding a dial. It answers scan commands sent
  during the dial itself and keeps them, then restores the scanner the way the host last asked once the dial
  completes or is cancelled. `counts.arbitrated` counts the dials it stepped in for.
- **Known limits of the rig, not of Knit:**
  - Zephyr refuses a second accept-list dial while a link it dialed is up (`0x0b`, ACL Connection Already Exists):
    `ll_create_connection` records the command's all-zero peer address on the link, and its same-peer check then
    matches the next accept-list dial. GD always dials through the accept list, so the emulator dials one peer at a
    time; links it accepts are unaffected. The cure is `CONFIG_BT_CTLR_ALLOW_SAME_PEER_CONN=y` in `knit-hci`.
  - A dongle let go of mid-stream wedged Zephyr's USB HCI class until a replug, so the bridge resets the controller
    on its way out (`quiesce`, on SIGINT or SIGTERM) and rebinds btusb (`give_back`).
